# ec530-P2P-hackathon

Author: Carmen Hurtado 

## Project Description
Create a peer to peer chat architecture. Each peer (client) will have its own local database that is implemented using SQLite. 
There is a rendezvous server that is used to set up a hadshake between the clients and can be turned off afterwards leaving us with a P2P module.
